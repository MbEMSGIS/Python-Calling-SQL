# Python-Calling-SQL
I am using a Python script in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop to call a complex SQL query
While still fairly new to Python in the ESRI envoriment I have had some success 
and am now being asked a larger task.  Part of the solution to this task requires
'calling' an SQL script, developed by a colleague to, into ESRI ArcGIS Desktop v10.4,
My plan is to call several parameters from the user (date time frame, priority 
classifications etc) from a Desktop interface which will then pass these variables 
into the SQL code.  

I have created the Query layers for the SQL tables which are called by the developed 
SQL code (DSQL here on) and am experimenting with calling SQL. So far I can get simple 
queries accomplished but have not yet figured out how to run case statements etc.  
So far my Python script is very rudimentary and will remain such until I have the SQL.

I will post the code and my attempts to resolve my challenges as I go.
